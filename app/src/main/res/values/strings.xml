    <string name="about_text">Welcome to the Galilee - one of the most beautiful regions of Israel.
        Situated in the north of the country, it is characterized by its beautiful lush landscape
        with agriculture, amazing natural landforms, historic sites, and quaint rural villages.
        Galilee is a popular destination for domestic and foreign tourists who enjoy its scenic,
        recreational, and gastronomic offerings. The Galilee attracts many Christian pilgrims,
        as many of the miracles of Jesus occurred, according to the New Testament, on the shores
        of the Sea of Galilee. In addition, numerous sites of biblical importance are located
        in the Galilee, such as Megiddo, Jezreel Valley, Mount Tabor, Hatsor and more.
